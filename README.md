# CNSR chip 0 (work in progress)
Neural network control architecture for 40 instruction basic RISC-V

Design 0 implements binary neural network for boolean function equivalence for neural network. A network is trained to operate a collection of transistors based on 8-bit instructions it receives. Network configurations are learnt based on instructions from the instruction set, which is fed as input. 

implement von Neumann bottleneck solution, projection-based (Christos Papadimitriou) similarity-metric computation, probabilistic weight vector learning, analog wave computation (Anirban Bandyopadhyay), quantum retroactivity (Roger Penrose, Stuart Hameroff) in finite field arithmetic/turing computation. Information mechanics is the mathematical basis of this chip. Information mechanics describes the mathematics of complexity and gives an abstract definition to information.
